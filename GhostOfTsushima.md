Ghost of Tsushima is a story-driven, action-adventure open world game with combat and stealth elements. An anthology of smaller side stories surrounds the main plot. It is loosely based on historical events and should not be considered an accurate re-telling of history - it is purely for entertainment purposes only.

The year is 1274 AD on the island of Tsushima. Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan until the fearsome Mongol Empire invades, wreaking havoc and conquering Tsushima, defeating nearly all samurai stationed on Tsushima Island. As one of the last surviving samurai, Jin Sakai, rises from the ashes to fight back with help from his allies, but the honorable tactics and code of the samurai won't lead to a possible victory over the Mongols. Jin must move beyond samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting – the way of the Ghost – as he wages an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.

A re-release of the game along with an expansion, Ghost of Tsushima: Iki Island, was released on August 20, 2021, under the name Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, with the PlayStation 5 version having additional features such as haptic triggers, Japanese lip-sync, and faster loading times.

A PC port done by Nixxes was announced on March 6, 2024, and was released on May 16, 2024.

Ghost of Tsushima has full voice acting in either Japanese or English with multiple language options for subtitles. The English voice acting was recorded by Sucker Punch while the Japanese voice acting was overseen by SIE Japan Studio. Voice and subtitle languages can be changed throughout the game as players choose.
