The Witcher (Polish: Wied≈∫min) is a fantasy action role-playing game series developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, acting as non-canonical sequels to the story of the books.

The main series began in 2007 with the release of The Witcher, and concluded with 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As of 2022, the series has three main standalone games, two expansion packs and seven spin-off games. The series is critically acclaimed and commercially successful, selling over 75 million units by March 2023.

In March 2022, a fourth installment of the franchise was announced to be in early development[1] and is planned as the start of a new trilogy for the series.[2] In October 2022, a remake of The Witcher was announced. Fool's Theory will mainly develop the game with full creative supervision from The Witcher series staff and CD Projekt Red.[3] Another game will also be developed by The Molasses Flood and created with support from CDPR.

The series has spawned a series of graphic novels published by Dark Horse Comics.
